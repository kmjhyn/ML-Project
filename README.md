# ML-Project: Classifying MNIST Datasets




The final_project.ipynb is a jupyter notebook which contains all code portions of our application project. 
It is organized using markdown headings which should make it easy to identify what code is where.
It also contains all results used for this project, with the neural network results also having been output in output.txt.
These are all the results upon which our project / report / presentation are based.
The code is executable, so it can be run. Note however that if it is rerun, it will remove our results, although
the neural network results will be placed in a new output text document, so our results from the neural network
will still be contained in output.txt.
